This module provides examples on the various error handling techniques in elixir.

1. Launch iex: `iex error_handler.ex`
2. Play with division by zero and try/rescue: `ErrorHandling.safe_division(num1, num2)`
3. Play with throwing an error on finding zero in a list: `ErrorHandlinng.throw_on_zero([num1, num2, ... , numn])`
4. Play with exiting in a very short process: `ErrorHandling.shortest_living_process`
